# AI_Lab 2022 Group 3
This repository contains the work done by Group 3 for the 2022 Bocconi AI Lab. We have built a pipeline to obtain classification models to classify tumorous cells as hypoxic or normoxic.
This group was awarded first place in the competition. All details can be found in the Jupyter Notebook included in the repository.
