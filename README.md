# Single Cell Sequencing
This repository contains the work done by Group 3 for the 2022 Bocconi AI Lab. We have built a pipeline to obtain classification models to classify tumorous cells as hypoxic or normoxic. We performed EDA, data filtering and normalisation, dimensionality reduction and applied numerous clustering algorithms to identify patterns in the data. All details can be found in the Jupyter Notebook included in the repository.
This group was awarded first place in the competition. As a result, we received funding to present our work in the Department of Oncology of Oxford University, during their Bioinformatics Hub conference series.
